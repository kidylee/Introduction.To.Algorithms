### 2.2-3
Consider linear search again (see Exercise 2.1-3). 


#### How many elements of the input sequence need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? 

The average of checking count is 1/2n.


#### How about in the worst case? 
The worst case is n.

#### What are the average-case and worst-case running times of linear search in ‚Θ-notation? Justify your answers.

Both of them are Θ(n). The best case is 1/2n and constant coefficient is ignored.
